# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to documenting the requirement analysis phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It simulates a real-world scenario by outlining the requirements for a Booking Management System. The purpose is to explore how to gather, analyze, and document functional and non-functional requirements, define use cases, and establish clear acceptance criteria using industry-standard practices. This forms a strong foundation for successful and scalable software development.



## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system. It acts as a bridge between the client’s vision and the technical solution, ensuring that the development team fully understands what needs to be built.

This phase helps define **what the system should do** (functional requirements) and **how the system should behave** (non-functional requirements), such as performance, security, and usability. It also includes outlining user interactions, business rules, and system constraints.

### Importance in the SDLC:

- **Clarity and Alignment:** It ensures that both developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project goals and deliverables.
- **Reduces Risk:** By identifying requirements early, it reduces the chances of costly changes during later stages of development.
- **Guides Design and Development:** It provides a clear foundation for creating technical specifications, architectural decisions, and design documentation.
- **Improves Quality:** Well-defined requirements help ensure that the final product meets user needs and expectations.
- **Facilitates Testing:** Defined requirements are used to create test cases and acceptance criteria, helping to validate the software during and after development.

In summary, Requirement Analysis is essential for building software that is accurate, complete, and aligned with user goals, making it a foundational step in successful software projects.




## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase involves several structured activities that ensure a clear understanding of what the software system must achieve. Below are the five key activities involved:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the initial step where information is collected from stakeholders, users, and other sources to understand their needs, expectations, and business objectives.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  This involves using techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation to actively uncover hidden or unspoken requirements from stakeholders.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  All gathered requirements are recorded in a clear and structured format. This documentation serves as a reference throughout the project and includes both functional and non-functional requirements.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Requirements are analyzed for clarity, consistency, and feasibility. This may include grouping, prioritizing, and modeling requirements using tools like use case diagrams or flowcharts.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  The documented and analyzed requirements are reviewed and confirmed by stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and alignment with business goals. This step helps detect and correct any misunderstandings before development begins.




## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally classified into two main categories: functional and non-functional. Both are essential for building a complete and effective system.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They define specific behaviors, features, and functions that the software must support to meet user and business needs.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users must be able to create, update, and cancel bookings.
- The system should allow users to register and log in with a secure password.
- Admins can add, edit, or remove available booking slots.
- Users should receive a confirmation email after booking.
- The system must allow users to search for bookings by date, category, or location.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should behave**. These relate to performance, usability, security, and other quality attributes that affect user experience and system reliability.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system should support up to 1000 concurrent users without performance issues.
- All personal data must be stored securely using encryption techniques.
- The booking interface should be mobile-responsive and accessible to users with disabilities.
- The system should send booking confirmations within 60 seconds of transaction completion.
- The platform should be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).

Understanding and addressing both types of requirements ensures the software is not only functional but also reliable, secure, and user-friendly.






## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help identify and organize system functionality from a user's perspective, making it easier to understand what the system should do and how users will interact with it.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Clearly define system boundaries and user roles  
- Visualize system functionality at a high level  
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders  
- Serve as a foundation for writing detailed use case descriptions  

### Use Case Diagram for Booking Management System

The following diagram shows the main actors and their interactions with the system:

- **Actors:**
  - User (Customer)
  - Admin

- **Use Cases:**
  - Register/Login
  - View Bookings
  - Create Booking
  - Cancel Booking
  - Edit Booking
  - Receive Notification
  - Manage Booking Inventory (Admin)
  - Manage Users (Admin)
  - View Reports (Admin)











## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by the user, client, or other stakeholders. They help define the boundaries of a user story or feature and serve as the basis for validating that the functionality works as intended.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria

- **Clarity**: Provides a clear understanding of what is expected for a feature to be considered complete.
- **Alignment**: Ensures all stakeholders (developers, testers, clients) are on the same page.
- **Testability**: Forms the basis for creating test cases and verifying that the feature behaves as required.
- **Prevents Misunderstandings**: Reduces ambiguity and scope creep during development.

### Example: Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature

**Feature**: Booking Checkout

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The user must be logged in to complete the checkout process.
- The system must display a booking summary before final confirmation.
- The user can select a payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
- Payment details must be validated before submission.
- A confirmation page is displayed after successful payment.
- The user receives a confirmation email with booking details within 2 minutes.
- The booking is stored in the user’s account and marked as "Confirmed."

These criteria ensure that the Checkout feature meets user expectations and functions correctly before it is marked as complete.
